	*** Welcome to the Rings Ray Tracing Engine ***

* To run this package you will need to perform a few simple steps:

1. Download and install JRE 1.4 or higher from www.java.com.
2. Make sure the JRE bin directory is in your PATH. If not:
	- Find the directory you installed the JRE to and find
	  a directory inside it that is called "bin".
	- Copy the full path of this directory.
	- Open a terminal window and type one of the following:
        PATH=<path to the 'bin' directory>:$PATH ; export PATH    (if you use csh)
        setenv PATH <path to the 'bin' directory>:$PATH           (if you use sh)
      Where <path to the 'bin' directory> is the path you copied
3. Download the latest Rings jar file from j3d.sf.net and put it in
   the rings/bin directory.
4. Now you are ready to run the application by executing the sh script "rings/bin/rings".
