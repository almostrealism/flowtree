	*** Welcome to the Rings Ray Tracing Engine ***

* To run this package you will need to perform a few simple steps:

1. Download and install JRE 1.4 or higher from www.java.com.

IMPORTANT: The steps below may not be necesary with new jvm instalation packages,
           so first test steps 6 - 7. If it fails, then do steps 2 - 5.

2. Now find the directory you installed the jre to and find a directory inside it that is called "bin".
3. Copy the full path of this directory.
4. Open a file on your local drive (C:) that should be called autoexec.bat
5. At the end of the file add this:
     set PATH = %PATH%;<path to the 'bin' directory>
     Where <path to the 'bin' directory> is the path you copied in step 3 and 4
6. Download the latest Rings jar file from j3d.sf.net and put it in
   the rings/bin directory.
7. Now you are ready to run the application by executing "rings/bin/rings.bat".
