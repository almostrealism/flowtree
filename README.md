The simplicity of these libraries will hopefully make up for the fact that I have limited time to write documentation. Please feel free to contact me with questions if you have them.

## Package Overview ðŸ”¶ ##
Distributed parallel processing system for computer graphics, physics and more. *This project requires a retired apache project (**Slide**) and will be upgraded to use a different WebDav library in the future. Also, this project uses HSQLDB optionally (by default), but can be configured to use any SQL relational database.*

## Maintainence Schedule ##
| **FlowTree** is on an apprximately 10 week lag. I can fix bugs on that horizon.
